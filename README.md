# Marbles

This code allows user to create tables and rows dynamically. This table layout concept is used to find the area of the marble.
The tables and rows created in this app can be saved to Phone's Storage.

* This is done by saving the contents of the tables and rows in the JSON file.
* Table fetches the data from the JSON file and restores to the previously saved version.
* This is able to create new rows and tables dynamically.
* This is able to take the Name, Address, Phone No, Date and *size of marbles * in the table.
